# C Learning – Practice and Mini-Projects

A repo for learning and practicing **C**: exercises, utilities, and embedded-friendly patterns. My goal is to create a solid foundation so later on I can work on embedded systems using **C/C++**.

## Structure

```
exercises/    # K&R + misc practice
projects/     # Small tools & embedded-prep code
tests/        # Unit tests
docs/         # Notes & cheatsheets
```

## Getting Started

* Compiler: **GCC** or **Clang**
* Build: `make` (or plain `gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c17 ...`)
* Format: `clang-format -i *.c *.h`

```bash
# Build & run example
make run DIR=exercises/kr/1-10
```

## Goals

* Work through K&R exercises
* Practice file I/O, strings, and algorithms
* Build portable code for future embedded projects

## Progress

* K&R Ch. 1–2
* String functions (strlen, strcpy, etc.)
* Word count (wc), grep-lite
* Ring buffer, fixed-point math

## Resources

* The C Programming Language (K&R)
* SEI CERT C guidelines
* Embedded Artistry blog
